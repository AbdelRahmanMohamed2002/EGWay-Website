Privacy on EGWAY - An Overview :
EGWAY is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of the consumers who use its interactive products and services. Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for these consumers.<br>

The purpose of this EGWAY Privacy Policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to EGWAY, of what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit EGWAY, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. This privacy policy applies to the ​EGWAY web site and other Internet-accessible EGWAY-branded services that incorporate this policy (although we will refer here only to EGWAY to make reading this policy easier). Other EGWAY products and services may also have their own privacy policies, which you should review when you use these services.
Finally, please note that this policy applies only to EGWAY, and not to other companies' or organizations' web sites to which we link.<br>

Information About All EGWAY Visitors :<br>
In general, our site automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to EGWAY Anywhere and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This aggregate data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, EGWAY Anywhere uses a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages on our site are visited, and by how many people. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through these cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our EGWAY Anywhere partners about how our members, collectively, use EGWAY Anywhere. We do this so they too can understand how many people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible web experience as well. Finally, EGWAY Anywhere, its advertisers and ad servers may also use cookies, as well as small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs," to determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them, but do not use these technologies to collect personally identifiable information unless you give us permission to do so.
<br>
